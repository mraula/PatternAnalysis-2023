# UNet Segmention on the ISIC 2017/8 data set

### Description: 
The task is to preform image segmentaion on the ISIC 2017/8 dataset. The implementation will employ a UNet convolutional network model for accurate segmentation. The UNet will take the given images and their coresponing Ground truth masks to which it will try to predict a mask.
